# Introduction to JavaScript for Seasoned Programmers
> This is the GitHub repository for Kayla Pringle's CS 330 Programming Language Project, which provides a tutorial on JavaScript for programmers experienced with other languages but not directly with JavaScript. All resources will be referenced via footnotes and can be found at the bottom of the page.

## History

JavaScript is a programming language that was created in May 1995 by Brendan Eich. Fun fact, it only took Eich ten days to develop the language! Originally named Mocha, the language was renamed to LiveScript and, in December 1995, renamed to the title we know and love today: JavaScript.[^1] It was initially developed to implement dynamic features on web pages on the user-side, meaning that anytime a website does more than sit there, JavaScript is involved. For developing websites, it is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS. HTML provides the structure of a website's content, including paragraphs, headings, and embedding videos. I like to think of CSS as the "pretty language," as it allows you to style a page. JavaScript is the scripting language that enables features such as live-time content modification on a webpage, controlling multimedia, animating images, and many other applications.[^2] For information about this language, when it's time to start programming, this tutorial will use guidance from the [Geeks for Geeks JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-tutorial/), but we will make it our own![^3] We may also pull information from [W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) as well, but this tutorial is for beginners+, as I like to call it, as I know you will have past coding experience.[^4] Finally, we will seek guidance from Dr.Dr. Axel Rauschmayer's book ["Exploring JavaScript"](https://exploringjs.com/js/book/index.html). Dr.Rauschmayer specializes in JavaScript, TypeScript, and web development.[^5]

## Let's Get Started! üèÉüí®

To begin, you must install JavaScript to run it. You can do so by visiting [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and following the installation instructions. I think you should use the prebuilt Node.js for your respective system, as the installation wizard is efficient and installs all the additional tools you need! Although there is no recommended programming environment, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is free, straightforward, widely used as a coding IDE, easily customizable, and I have the most experience using it, so we will be using that one for this tutorial. Now, the caveat is that you must install a Code Runner extension in order to actually run the code in VS Code, as you can create any JavaScript file you'd like, but VS Code does not have built-in support to do so. I suggest using the Code Runner extension with the extension ID found [here](formulahendry.code-runner). I recommend it as it supports a multitude of languages and has a straightforward installation process. I have also linked it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner), and it should be the first extension at the top of the list when you search for "Code Runner" in the extensions tab in VS Code. I would suggest that you install it directly in VS Code via the extension ID to avoid any issues. I have included a screenshot below to ensure that you can correctly identify the extension, as I have also been confused about which ones to install for different languages myself. You will then need to shut down VS Code entirely, close any open files, and open a new window for the extension to function correctly. Now you are ready to start programming!
