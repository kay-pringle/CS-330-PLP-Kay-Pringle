## History

JavaScript is a programming language that was created in May 1995 by Brendan Eich. Fun fact, it only took Eich ten days to develop the language![^1] It was initially developed to implement dynamic features on web pages, meaning that anytime a web page does more than sit there, JavaScript is involved. For developing websites, it is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS. HTML provides the structure of a website's content, including paragraphs, headings, and embedding videos. I like to know CSS as the "pretty language", as you can use it to style the page. JavaScript is the scripting language that enables features such as live-time content modification on a webpage, controlling multimedia, animating images, and many other applications.[^2] For information about this language when it's time to start programming, this tutorial will use guidance from the [Geeks for Geeks JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-tutorial/), but we will make it our own!
