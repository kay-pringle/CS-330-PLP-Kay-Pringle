# Introduction to JavaScript for Seasoned Programmers
> This is the GitHub repository for Kayla Pringle's CS 330 Programming Language Project, which provides a tutorial on JavaScript for programmers experienced with other languages but not directly with JavaScript. All resources will be referenced via footnotes and can be found at the bottom of the page.

## History

JavaScript is a programming language that was created in May 1995 by Brendan Eich. Fun fact, it only took Eich ten days to develop the language! Originally named Mocha, the language was renamed to LiveScript and, in December 1995, renamed to the title we know and love today: JavaScript.[^1] It was initially developed to implement dynamic features on web pages on the user-side, meaning that anytime a website does more than sit there, JavaScript is involved. For developing websites, it is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS. HTML provides the structure of a website's content, including paragraphs, headings, and embedding videos. I like to think of CSS as the "pretty language," as it allows you to style a page. JavaScript is the scripting language that enables features such as live-time content modification on a webpage, controlling multimedia, animating images, and many other applications.[^2] For information about this language, when it's time to start programming, this tutorial will use guidance from the [Geeks for Geeks JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-tutorial/), but we will make it our own![^3] We may also pull information from [W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) as well, but this tutorial is for beginners+, as I like to call it, as I know you will have past coding experience.[^4] Finally, we will seek guidance from Dr.Dr. Axel Rauschmayer's book ["Exploring JavaScript"](https://exploringjs.com/js/book/index.html). Dr.Rauschmayer specializes in JavaScript, TypeScript, and web development.[^5]

## Let's Get Started! üèÉüí®

To begin, you must install Javascript to run be able to use it! You can do so by visiting [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and following the instructions to install the language. I reccomend using the
